# Steganography

Steganography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret message within an ordinary message and the extraction of it at its destination. It is the art of hiding information within the image, audio, or video file. The file that contains the hidden message is known as the "cover" file, and the message is known as the "payload."

How does it work?
Steganography works by replacing some of the bits in the cover file with bits from the payload. The bits in the cover file that are replaced are selected in such a way that they don't significantly affect the quality of the cover file. The result is a seemingly ordinary file that contains the hidden message.

Applications of Steganography
Steganography has various applications, including:

Secure communication between parties
Watermarking digital media
Data hiding for data protection and privacy
Tools for Steganography
There are various tools available for Steganography, both free and paid, for various platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS. Some popular tools are:

Steghide
OutGuess
Stegosuite
Limitations of Steganography
Steganography has its limitations, including:

Limited payload capacity: The amount of payload that can be hidden is limited by the size of the cover file.
Susceptibility to attacks: Steganography is susceptible to various attacks, such as statistical analysis and visual inspection.
